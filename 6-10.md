# OWASP Top 10 - A Primer
This document explores the 10 vulnerability classes discussed in [OWASP Top 10 - 2017](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf).

## Vulnerabilities
### A3:2017 - Sensitive Data Exposure
#### Definition / Description

#### Source
- Any data that is not protected is vulnerable. This includes data being transmitted in clear text, passwords or sensitive data not being encrypted, encrypted data using old or weal cryptographic algorithms, weak generated crypto keys, or are the user agents verifying if the received server certificate is valid.

#### Severity
- Severe

#### Scope
- Failure to keep sensitive data protected can result in sensitive personal information data such as health records, credentials, personal data, and credit cards to be accessed by an attacker.

#### How it Works
- In the case of a Local File Inclusion attack, once the attacker is able to trick the Web Application into running a malicious payload the would be able to gain access to the server and can then retrieve any data being stored on that server. If any data is stored in plain text or use weak hashing or cryptographic algorithms the attacker is privy to all that information.

#### Scenario
- In order to perform Local File Inclusion access to the server needs to be obtained. The attacker can use a tool like Metasploitable and find an ssh vulnerability in order to log into the DVWA server and open up a shell. From there if allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include are set to On the attacker can create a script and insert it into the path so that when called the script will then run on the Web Application.

- In this case, I created a script that echo’s “Success” onto the page when the specific URL path is called. 
- LFI works by gaining access to the server and opening up a shell in order to create scripts within the file paths. This can only occur of the PHP file inclusion vulnerability is set to on. 
- In order to prevent this type of attack, the server simply needs to set allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include to Off.

### A4:2017 - XML External Entities (XXE)
#### Definition / Description

#### Source
- XML-based web services are vulnerable to XXE attacks. This includes applications that accept XML directly or XML uploads, especially from untrusted sources or inserts untrusted data into XML documents, which is then parsed by an XML processor.

#### Severity
- Severe

#### Scope
- XXE attacks can be used to extract data, execute a remote request from the server, scan internal systems, perform a denial-of-service attack, as well as execute other attacks.

#### How it Works
- XML (Extensible Markup Language) is a tool used for storing and transferring data. However XML by itself doesn’t actually do anything. It’s simply information wrapped inside tags.
- Web applications use XML by storing data in plain text. Which provides a software- and hardware-independent way of storing, transporting and sharing data.
- XML documents can contain “entities” that are defined using a system identifier and are present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or remote content. The entity can permit remote content to be substituted in the document. Thus, an attacker can send their own values through the entity and make the application display it. The attacker forces the XML parser to access the resource specified by them which could be a file on the system or on any remote system and display it to the user.

##### Ways that XXE payloads can be delivered:
- Submitting an HTTP request with a crafted XXE payload.
- Taking advantage of a “file upload” function that uses an XML MIME type.

#### Scenario

##### Payload 1
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?> <!DOCTYPE foo [
<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]> <foo>&xxe;</foo>
 ```

- This payload is used to retrieve the attributes of each user or account on the computer.
- Broken access control can be another factor in this if user restrictions are not properly enforced.
 
 ##### Payload 2
```xml
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "https://192.168.1.1/private" >]>
 ```
- Here the attacker is trying to include an external file within the XML document.
- XXS if the application includes untrusted data without proper validation or escaping.

##### Payload 3
```xml
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" >]>
 ```
- The attacker is trying to perform a denial-of-service attack.
- Using components with known vulnerabilities. /dev/random is built in function of Linux the attacker is taking advantage of.

### A5:2017 - Broken Access Control
#### Definition / Description

#### Source
- Access control can be bypassed through modifying the URL, internal application state, or the HTML page.
- Allowing a primary key to be changed to another users record, permitting viewing or editing of someone else’s account.
- Elevation of privilege. A standard user acting as the admin.

#### Severity
- Severe

#### Scope
- Attackers can act as users or administrators within a system which can give them access to create, read, update or delete records.

#### How it Works
- LFI can also qualify as a Broken Access Control vulnerability as you are bypassing any access controls through utilizing a vulnerability in PHP. Allowing you to write file to the server without having to gain user or admin access.

#### Scenario
Suppose you log into an application as the user `jane`, and get redirected to: `https://example.site/userProfile.php?user=jane`.

Suppose Jane is able to see Bob's profile by navigating to: `https://example.site/userProfile.php?user=bob`
- This is called **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** Read about it here: <
>.

- This website is not requiring any authentication in order to view other users profile information.

### A7:2017 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
#### Definition / Description
#### Source:
 - XSS can occur when the Application or API includes unvalidated or unescaped user input as part of the HTML output, store unsanitized user input into the database until view or used by another user, and JS frameworks, APIs or single page Applications that dynamically include attacker-controllable data to a page.

#### Severity:
 - Moderate for Reflected and DOM XSS, Severe for Stored XSS attacks.

#### Scope:
 - With remote code execution on the victim's browser, attackers can steal credentials, sessions, or delivering malware to the victim.

#### Three Classes of XSS vulnerabilities
- Reflected XSS
- DOM XSS
- Stored XSS
 
#### How it Works
- An Reflected XSS payload works by the attacker injecting unwanted executable JavaScript into a web site usually occurring within a GET request that is printed or echoed to the screen without filtering its content. The Web application then runs this malicious script and it gets reflected onto the webpage.

#### Scenario
- During a Reflected XSS attack on DVWA, the malicious script is inserted into the HTTP Get request. Due to the input field not being sanitized the JavaScript code is then run and in this instance, an alert pops up displaying the injected message. 

```
GET /dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<script>alert(Hello!!!)</script> HTTP/1.1

```


### A8:2017 - Insecure Deserialization
#### Definition / Description
- Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format in which can then be saved to a file or datastore. The format in which it can save into is either as binary or a type of structured text (XML, JSON). 
- Deserialization is the transforming of the serialized data back into an object.
- Web applications use serialization and deserialization regularly in order to store and retrieve data.
- Applications will be vulnerable if they deserialize hostile or tampered objects.
- The attacker can modify application logic or achieve remote code execution if there are classes available to the application that can change behavior during or after deserialization.

#### How it Works / Scenario
- The exploit in the Acutenix article achieves remote code execution through the attacker first serializing the exploit to return ‘whoami’. The application then insecurely deserializes the data and the function runs the code and loads it onto the server. The payload then runs the command ‘whoami’.

### A9:2017 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
#### Definition / Description
- Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application and are all various types of vulnerabilities within an application.

#### How it Works
- Supply chain risk can occur through poor manufacturing, counterfeits, tampering, and/or malicious code. 
- Where the supply comes from and who is making it is becoming very important with every increasing price to pay for loss of control over product and services. 

#### Scenario
TODO: Read about the [leftpad incident](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/), and discuss how this scenario almost seems like an accidental DoS attack.
- The left-pad debacle can almost be considered a DoS attack as through Koculu’s removal of the NPM package thousands of NPM packages that relied on left-pad to function stopped working and cause thousands of open-source infrastructure to fall over during development and deployment.

### A10:2017 - Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
#### Definition / Description
- Insufficient logging and monitoring, along with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data.

#### How it Works / Scenario
- An open source project forum software was hacked. The attackers managed to wipe out the internal source code repository containing the next version, and all of the forum contents. The projects lack of monitoring, logging or alerting led to a far worse breach then could have been prevented. This forum software project is no longer active as a result of this issue.
