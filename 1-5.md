# OWASP Top 10 - A Primer
This document explores the 10 vulnerability classes discussed in [OWASP Top 10 - 2017](https://www.owasp.org/images/7/72/OWASP_Top_10-2017_%28en%29.pdf.pdf).

## Vulnerabilities
### A1:2017 - Injections
#### Definition / Description
#### Source:
 - Any fields of data can be used as an attack vector. Environment variables, parameters, external and internal web services, and all types of users. These types of attacks occur when an attacker can send hostile data to an interpreter.

#### Severity:
 - Severe

#### Scope:
 - Injections can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, or denial of access. Can sometimes lead to complete host takeover.

#### Example Attacks:
 - Vulnerable SQL calls can be made to the database if the application uses untrusted data. An application’s blind trust in frameworks may result in queries that are still vulnerable.

#### How it Works
- An attacker may first use a tool to see what type of language the Web Application uses to CRUD data from the server. Then the attacker would proceed to figure out the structure of the SQL query/injection and see if they are able to edit the query within the Webform to request more data from the server. From there they would run tests to see how much information they can get out of the database. 

#### Scenario
Explanation of the UNION injection in the following URL: <
>
 - The UNION attack is used to retrieve data from other tables within the database.
 - For a UNION query to work it must return the same number of columns and the data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.

Explanation of SQL query:
 - id=1 UNION SELECT 1,concat(login,':',password),3,4 FROM users
 - The response delivered from the server: admin:8efe310f9ab3efeae8d410a8e0166eb2
 - “id=1” is returning one row and 4 columns.
 - The SELECT statement following is returning those 4 columns but in order to extract the information from column number 2 to attacker is combining the login and password information contained within that column together. 

How to Prevent
 - The Web Application can use a safe API, that avoids the use of the interpreter entirely.
 - Server-side input validation that sanitizes input sections.

### A2:2017 - Broken Authentication
#### Definition / Description
#### Source:
 - Depending on the design and implementation of identity and access controls. Session management is a significant attack surface. Broken authentication can also be exploited through password lists and dictionary attacks.

#### Severity:
 - Severe

#### Scope:
 - Attackers only need to gain access to a few accounts, or one admin account to compromise the system. This may allow money laundering, social security fraud, and identity theft, or expose legally protected highly sensitive information.

#### Example Attacks:
 - Credential stuffing, using a list of known passwords to determine if the credentials are valid.
 - Application session timeouts. When a user closes the browser and does not log out and an attacker gains access to the computer while the user is still logged in. 

#### How it Works
 - In the example below the web application is allowing multiple login attempts by the same user. There is no limit to how many attempts the attacker can make causing it to be vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

#### Scenario
- Intercept a request to the login form
- Set positions around the username and password
- Provide a list of usernames and passwords to test
- Use Intruder to brute-force the login form

```

##### Mitigation
 - Multi-factor authentication in order to prevent automated, credential stuffing, brute-force, and stolen credential re-use attacks.
 - Limit or increasingly delay failed login attempts. Logging all failures and alerting admins of suspicious behavior.

### A6:2017 - Security Misconfiguration
#### Definition / Description
#### Source:
 -Security Misconfigurations can happen at any level of the application stack including but not limited to unpatched flaws, access of default accounts, or unprotected files and directories.
#### Severity:
 - Moderate.

#### Scope:
 - Attackers may gain unauthorized access to some system functionalities or data. On occasion, these flaws can result in a complete system compromise.

#### Example Attacks:
 - The application server comes with sample applications that are not removed from the production server which have known security flaws that an attacker is able to compromise server with.
 - A cloud service provider has default sharing permissions open to the Internet by other CSP users. This allows sensitive data stored within cloud storage to be accessed.

#### How it Works
- allow_url_fopen allows an user or attacker to provide a url to, for instance, an image. The app will then use allow_url_fopen to download and store that image. Which in a security case could be a malicious file.
- allow_url_include allows the data retrieval from remote locations allowing for fopen to grab files. 
- RFI is possible when an attacker is able to have the application download a malicious file. So any area or component of the application the functions to download from external sources is a vulnerability.
- - RFI on DVWA qualifies as a Security Misconfiguration vulnerability due to allow_url_include and allow_url_fopen being a normal component to the PHP framework.

#### Scenario
- In order to prevent this form of RFI you must disable php allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include you must modify the directive in the php.ini file.

  ```php
allow_url_fopen = off
allow_url_include = off
  ```

### A7:2017 - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
#### Definition / Description
#### Source:
 - XSS can occur when the Application or API includes unvalidated or unescaped user input as part of the HTML output, store unsanitized user input into the database until view or used by another user, and JS frameworks, APIs or single page Applications that dynamically include attacker-controllable data to a page.

#### Severity:
 - Moderate for Reflected and DOM XSS, Severe for Stored XSS attacks.

#### Scope:
 - With remote code execution on the victim's browser, attackers can steal credentials, sessions, or delivering malware to the victim.

#### Three Classes of XSS vulnerabilities
- Reflected XSS
- DOM XSS
- Stored XSS
 
#### How it Works
- An Reflected XSS payload works by the attacker injecting unwanted executable JavaScript into a web site usually occurring within a GET request that is printed or echoed to the screen without filtering its content. The Web application then runs this malicious script and it gets reflected onto the webpage.

#### Scenario
- During a Reflected XSS attack on DVWA, the malicious script is inserted into the HTTP Get request. Due to the input field not being sanitized the JavaScript code is then run and in this instance, an alert pops up displaying the injected message. 

```
GET /dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=<script>alert(Hello!!!)</script> HTTP/1.1

Host: 127.0.0.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Referer: http://127.0.0.1/dvwa/vulnerabilities/xss_r/

Cookie: security=low; PHPSESSID=l3q4o5hsovmp2fi1suhua7lbgf
